# xApps ("dApps")

## xApp requirements

### All xApps:

* The xApp should be self explanatory, or do a good job explaining to the users what the xApp offers in the very first screen the xApp shows
* xApps can not be designed in a way where it it completely unclear to end users if they are using a third party developed xApp or a XRPL Labs maintained component

### Sandboxed xApps

* Full access, no restrictions, but only for the developer and max. 10 testers (whitelisted by Device UUID in the Xumm Developer Console)

### Link (QR/Deeplink) only xApps

* The xApp should look appealing
* The xApp should respect different Xumm user screen sizes
* The xApp should be well crafted: it should be clear what the xApp will do, and it should do what the xApp promised to do
* The xApp should have a clear Support workflow & offer terms & conditions & a privacy statement

### Public (listed) xApps:

* The xApp should not be a "launchpad" to something that could be perfectly located at a website: if there is no actual Xumm wallet/XRPL interaction where the integration with Xumm adds value, it should be a website, not an xApp
* Offer value (features people will appreciate/need) for a large part of the XRPL / Xumm user base
