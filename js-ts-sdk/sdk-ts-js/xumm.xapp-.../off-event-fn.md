  Certain events are sent to xApps. These events are usually an asynchronous
  callback containing data requested by calling one of the xApp UI actions.

# off(event, fn)

The `off(...)` method on the Xumm SDK's `xapp` object allows you to deregister an event handler. For the available event handlers, please see the [on-event-fn.md](on-event-fn.md "mention") page.
