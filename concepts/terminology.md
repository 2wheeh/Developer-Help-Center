# Terminology

|              **Xumm** | The self custodial wallet application application for iOS and Android developed by XRPL Labs. The app can be used by end users to manage their XRP Ledger account(s) and interact with the "Xumm Platform" (see below) through "Sign Requests" (see below).                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

|     **Xumm Platform** | The platform your application and the Xumm app (iOS/Android) interact with. For developers, the platform offers the ability to send "Sign Requests" (see below) to the platform's "API" (see below). The Sign Request can then be interacted with by Xumm app users.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|          **Xumm API** | The endpoints providing features to developers & integrated applications. The API endpoint reference can be found here: [https://xumm.readme.io/reference](https://xumm.readme.io/reference) but a more convenient way to interact with the Xumm Platform is through our SDK's (packages): [https://docs.xumm.dev/#packages](https://docs.xumm.dev/#packages)                                                                                                                |
| **Developer Console** | The Developer Console is where you can get your credentials (API Key & secret) and configure your Xumm platform integration. You can find the Xumm Developer Console at [https://apps.xumm.dev](https://apps.xumm.dev/)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **API Documentation** | API endpoint reference: [https://xumm.readme.io/reference](https://xumm.readme.io/reference)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|      **Sign Request** | When you send a call to the Xumm Platform to ask a user to sign a transaction, you are creating a "Sign Request". You are delivering a "Payload" (see below) to the Xumm platform, containing the transaction template you would like the user to sign & possibly some options. You obtain a unique UUID (identifier) to the Sign Request to get real time status updates, Webhooks upon status change & when signed: the on ledger Transaction Hash and signed transaction. |
|           **Payload** | The Payload (JSON formatted) is part of a Sign Request. It contains the Transaction Template to offer to the end user to sign. The Payload matches the formatting, fields & properties of native XRP Ledger transactions, except for the fact that some fields (like Fee, Account, Sequence) can be omitted as Xumm can add these for you.                                                                                                                                   |
|              **xApp** | An xApp is a Web App (HTML, JS, CSS) that can be opened inside Xumm by users, straight from and in Xumm. See [xapps-dapps](../environments/xapps-dapps/ "mention")                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|          **Frontend** | When referred to Frontend, we refer to **your** frontend: the HTML/JS/CSS application you are building, where you are integrating Xumm as [xapps-dapps](../environments/xapps-dapps/ "mention")or [browser-web3](../environments/browser-web3/ "mention") application.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|           **Backend** | Whe referred to Backend, we refer to **your** backend application. If you are building an xApp or Web3 (Browser) app, you may not have and may not need your own backend. If you are building a backend integration (e.g. headless application, backend for your own Frontend application), please see [backend-sdk-api.md](../environments/backend-sdk-api.md "mention")                                                                                                    |
|               **SDK** | The most convenient way to interact with the Xumm Platform is through our SDK's (packages): [https://docs.xumm.dev/#packages](https://docs.xumm.dev/#packages)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|               **JWT** | JSON Web Token: the authorization bearer as provided by Xumm when using the [xapps-dapps](../environments/xapps-dapps/ "mention") or [browser-web3](../environments/browser-web3/ "mention") flow. Valid for 24h, bound to the Xum App user, you can call the Xumm platform to create Sign Requests & more.                                                                                                                                                                  |
|               **OTT** | "One Time Token", specific to xApps. Automatically handled for you when using our [**Javascript/Typescript SDK**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xumm).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
