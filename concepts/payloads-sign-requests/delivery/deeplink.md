# Deep Link

This is particularly useful for mobile applications or web applications where you want to provide a seamless user experience.

* Origin on same device where Xumm is installed (iOS/Android)
* Origin can be own native app or webbrowser
* Linking to Xumm payload opens Xumm, return URL in payload can return to native application "Deep link" or webbrowser
  * Note: if browser: user will return to stock/OS default browser, not to same browser & tab originating from. Take care of session restore.
