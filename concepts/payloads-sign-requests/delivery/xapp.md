  If you are developing an xApp, you can use Xumm's xApp delivery method to
  integrate the payload within your xApp.

# xApp

* xApps can create a payload and deliver the payload straight to the user as the user is already in Xumm viewing the xApp.
* To show the payload to the user and get status updates on return, use the Xumm SDK (`xapp` section) [xumm.xapp-...](../../../js-ts-sdk/sdk-syntax/xumm.xapp-.../ "mention")
