# Mobile (iOS/Android)

Payload delivery from your native iOS / Android app happens through "Deep Links".&#x20;

Deep Linking allows your mobile app to communicate directly with the Xumm app, enabling users to interact with payloads effortlessly.&#x20;

For a detailed guide on implementing mobile payload delivery through Deep Linking, please refer to the [deeplink.md](deeplink.md "mention") page.
